This is the rs-rainflow library, a collection of functions to perform
rainflow cycle counting.  The implementation has several features:

   * The procedure is re-entrant (but not thread safe), that means
     you can call it multiple times in a row until all input data
     is processed.

   * Support for different signal data types.  You can switch the
     signal data type between consecutive invocations.

   * Support for signal labels.  This feature enables you to resolve
     information associated with a signal value, e.g. a load case
     number, from a cycle of the cycle counting sequence.

   * Support for alternative memory managers.

   * Cycles can be cached or shifted (consumed) according to your
     needs.

   * Cycles can be sorted and merged according to your needs.

See the file ‘NEWS’ for user-visible changes and new features compared
to recent versions of the rs-rainflow library.

The file ‘INSTALL’ contains information about how to build and install
the distribution.

You may encounter bugs in this release.  If you do, please report them
to the authors; see the file ‘AUTHORS’ for their mail addresses.

The ‘matlab’ directory contains a Matlab MEX-file command with many
nice features.  It works fine with GNU Octave, too.
